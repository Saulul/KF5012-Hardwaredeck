# Hardwaredeck CMS
**Strapi headless CMS for sending data to the React front-end.**

By Elliot Potts (W20017851) for KF5012.

## Installing
The CMS can be hosted locally with Node from this folder.

*Downloading the node_modules*

The Strapi server will now be running on http://localhost:1337

## Deployment

I plan to deploy this application to either an open Raspberry Pi 3 or to Heroku.
